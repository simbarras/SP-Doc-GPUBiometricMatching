abstract = {A biometrics system for identifying individuals using the pattern of veins in a finger was previously proposed. The system has the advantage of being resistant to forgery because the pattern is inside a finger. Infrared light is used to capture an image of a finger that shows the vein patterns, which have various widths and brightnesses that change temporally as a result of fluctuations in the amount of blood in the vein, depending on temperature, physical conditions, etc. To robustly extract the precise details of the depicted veins, we developed a method of calculating local maximum curvatures in cross-sectional profiles of a vein image. This method can extract the centerlines of the veins consistently without being affected by the fluctuations in vein width and brightness, so its pattern matching is highly accurate. Experimental results show that our method extracted patterns robustly when vein width and brightness fluctuated, and that the equal error rate for personal identification was 0.0009\%, which is much better than that of conventional methods.},

abstract = {The research group of which the authors are members has proposed a scheme based on finger vein patterns as a scheme of biometric identification utilizing biological information. Since the finger vein images taken to obtain finger vein patterns are obtained by irradiating the fingers with infrared rays, fluctuations in brightness due to variations in the light power or the thickness of the finger occur. This paper proposes a scheme for extracting global finger vein patterns by iteratively tracking local lines from various positions to robustly extract finger vein patterns from such unclear images. The proposed scheme is robust against brightness fluctuations as compared with the conventional feature extraction schemes and the results of evaluating the proposed scheme by applying it to a personal identification system showed an effective error rate of 0.145\%. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
